-------------- This is PARCOACH (PARallel COntrol flow Anomaly CHecker) -------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PARCOACH automatically checks MPI applications for correct use of MPI collective calls.

TODO: 
   - Interprocedural analysis
   - Dataflow analysis
   - Check MPI+OpenMP codes
   - Check OpenMP collectives
   - Check UPC collectives
   - Check general properties (e.g., non initialized variables) 



-- Prerequisites --

PARCOACH uses CMake. CMake can be downloaded from http://www.cmake.org

This version of PARCOACH is an LLVM pass. It works with LLVM 3.7.1.
